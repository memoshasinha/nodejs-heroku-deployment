## nodejs application deployment on heroku ##
To deploy the application on heroku, follow the below steps: -
* Create an app on Heroku, which prepares Heroku to receive your source code.
  heroku create <app-name>(this is optional, if no name is mentioned heroku provides a random name as shown below)
  Creating sharp-rain-871... done, stack is heroku-18

  I provided the application name, below is the application created
  heroku create nodejs-heroku-deployment
  Creating â¬¢ nodejs-heroku-deployment... done
  https://nodejs-heroku-deployment.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/nodejs-heroku-deployment.git

* When you create an app, a git remote (called heroku) is also created and associated with your local git repository.
  git push heroku master
* The application is now deployed. Ensure that at least one instance of the app is running:
  heroku ps:scale web=1
* Now visit the app at the URL generated by its app name. As a handy shortcut, you can open the website as follows:
  heroku open
